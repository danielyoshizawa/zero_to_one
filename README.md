# Zero to One
Software development course for beginners.

# About
This course is made for beginners in software development, we try to explain concepts in a easy way so students don't get overwhelmed and can learn on their own time.

This is an exercise based course, in each class we bring new concepts that complement the previous and try to connect the concepts improving previous projects to adapt to the students new understanding of programing.

This program uses a single concept per class to really enforce the importance of the fundamentals,

References are also added to the final of each class if the student wants to get an in-deep understanding of some concept.

We are trying not to impose any programing language, but the examples are written in C++ and Python, just by an author preference, you are free to choose what makes sense to you.
