## Linux or MacOS

### Command line (Terminal)

`python calculator.py`

if you have multiple python installations, or your default one is python 2, you may need to call the correct version of python. Try this instead.

`python3 calculator.py`

To check each version you are using.

`python --version`

or

`python3 --version`

## Windows

You are probably using an IDE so it will depend on the one you are using, usually is a play button. I have to admit that I have almost no knowledge on development in Windows environments nor with IDEs, I'll study more and update this file soon.
