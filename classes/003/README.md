# Class 003 - First Project
## Before we get started
You will need to define which language you will use for this course, install the necessary tools and learn about its fundamentals. The examples are write in C++ and Python, but you can use any that you feel more comfortable with.

To work on the projects you will need a text editor or an IDE to write your code, also need to consider how to run your programs, through the terminal (command line) or the IDE.

As an example, in my environment I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as the text editor and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for C++, and python I'm using the version 3.5.3, both I ran on the terminal. Operational System I'm using Debian 9, but you can use any OS that supports the language you choose.

I would also suggest [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free and run on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

## Say Hello
In computer science is a tradition to say **Hello World!** when starting a new project, this shows that the computer can understand us, or in other words, that our development environment is working.

This may look silly, but is of big importance, because this moment we are answering some very important questions for our project as a whole, which is the programing language, the development tools are installed, do I know how to run my programs, and the inputs result in the expected outputs?

## First Project
The proposal for our first project is a very simple calculator, the reason to this choice is because we are very familiar with the inputs and expected outputs in a simple calculator, this way, we don't need to worry about definitions at this moment.

The requirements for this project are, the user must input 2 integers, and the program must output the result of the sum of those inputs.

The inputs must be positive integers within the variable limits, each language has its own particularity but usually are very big, don't worry too much.

Remember to [Keep It Simple Sir](https://dev.to/kwereutosu/the-k-i-s-s-principle-in-programming-1jfg), use only the knowledge that you have and don't worry too much about other details, the idea is to learn the very basics.

## Breakdown
- Declare 2 variables
- Ask the user for the first input
- Ask the user for the second input
- Print the result to the console

## Important Concepts
**Input** everything provided by the user (person or machine) to your program.

**Output** everything that result from you program run.

**Variables** used to store information, it have a specific type (number, text, ... )

**Casting** converting variable types.

**Operations** changing the variables.
