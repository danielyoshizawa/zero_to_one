# CLASS 002 - Programming Languages
## Research and Decisions
Software development is all about research and making decisions, with a broad range of options to the same thing, and none being particularly right or wrong, we need to understand the scenario, our needs and most important, our preferences.

Everybody has a way of doing things, you need to find yours, that will be advantages and disadvantages compared to other scenarios, it is not easy to choose, but you must get used to it.

The first thing is research, usually on a search engine, you need to understand the differences between the options you have, so in this class I want to explain some of the different types of programming languages and its characteristics.

## Programming Paradigms
Programming paradigms are the classification of the languages according to its features, one language can belong to more than one group, it's called multiple paradigms.

We have a bunch of programming paradigms which are divided in 2 major groups, **Imperative** and **Declarative**, the Imperative group are the languages that instructs the machine how to work, giving then instructions to change its state. Declarative describes the expected result but not how to get there.

To not overload you with information, we will restrict this explanation to only to programming paradigms, [Procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) and [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), Procedural languages are based on procedures, which are a group of instructions that can be called from other parts of your code which will execute the block of code, Objected-Oriented languages are based on objects, which are groups of procedures (classes) and can contain fields (attributes), the same way you can reuse procedures you can reuse classes, this is a extremely over simplified explanation for more information check the reference links.

For this course we will use imperative languages, more precise, object-oriented languages, which is the most common in the industry.

## How to decide
You need to consider the [trade-offs](https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/language-tradeoffs), some languages will be faster to run while require compilation, others will be faster to develop but more prone to runtime errors, some are verbose but are easier to debug, but in the end, in my opinion, it's all about you personal preference, the language that you are more familiar with, or the one that you want to learn, you can do anything with any language.

## Environment Setup
Every programming language has an environment setup, you can usually find this on the language official website, or some tutorial, there is a bunch in the internet.

It is important to start to dig into documentation early on, because this is will be something that you will do for your entire carrier as a software developer, and you need to get proficient in setting up environments.

Just to give a basic idea of what you need to do, after you decide which language you will need to install the tools for your operational system (Windows, MacOS or Linux), this usually consists of the language libraries, a compiler in case of compiled languages, and IDE or Text Editor, and maybe some environment variables.

## Too much to decide
I know this is overwhelming for someone who is just starting with programming, so don't worry too much about it, just know that this things exists and when the time comes to you make a decision for your projects you will know what to look for.

For our classes we will have examples written in Python and C++, those are very different languages that will give an idea of how to achieve the same with different tools, just pick one and you will be fine.
