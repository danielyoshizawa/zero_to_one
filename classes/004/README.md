# Class 004 - One more step
## New Operation
Following our course, let's improve a little our project, on the previous class we created a calculator with only one operation, now we are going to add a new operation and let the user decide which one to use.

The idea here is to create small increments on our project, so this way the student can take its own time to learn and evolve.

## Minus operation
On this part of the project we are going to add the subtraction operation, the concept is the same of the addition, we will take 2 arguments from the user, but now, ask for which operation to use.

## Breakdown
- Adapt our calculator to do a new operation
- The user will decide which one to use
- The new operation is minus (a - b)

## Important Concepts
**If/else** - Used to make decisions
